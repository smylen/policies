Smylen's CTO has built the company policies, procedures, and technology with HIPAA/HITRUST in mind and is seeking a firm to conduct an audit to verify this claim. Notwithstanding, Smylen's platform was built by security and privacy experts, runs entirely on AWS using its highest grade of security tooling; current production systems on AWS will be included in Smylen's third-party audits and HITRUST certification.</p> <p>Smylen signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its Customers who are dentists and the covered entity. These BAAs outline Smylen obligations and dentist obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. Smylen does not manage aspects of compliance for Customers. Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, Smylen Customers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of Smylen.</p> <p>Smylen does not act as a covered entity. When Smylen does operate as a business associate (not a subcontractor), Smylen provides access to ePHI in the platform only to those delivering or receiving treatment.</p> <p>Smylen signed a BAA with AWS as they manage the security of our infrastructure from datacenter, network up to but not including the application and data.

Business Associate will make available to Customer the information required to provide an accounting of Disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.528 of which Business Associate is aware, if requested by Customer. Because Business Associate cannot readily identify which Individuals are identified or what types of PHI are included in Customer Content, Customer will be solely responsible for identifying which Individuals, if any, may have been included in Customer Content that Provider has disclosed and for providing a brief description of the PHI disclosed.</li> <li>Internal Records. Provider will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the Use and Disclosure of PHI available to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") for purposes of determining Customer compliance with HIPAA. Nothing in this section will waive any applicable privilege or protection, including with respect to trade secrets and confidential commercial information.</li> <li>Customer's Obligations:</li> <li>Appropriate Use of HIPAA Accounts. Customer is responsible for implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards in order to protect PHI in compliance with HIPAA and this BAA. Without limitation, Customer shall: (i) not include protected health information (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) in any Services that are not or cannot be HIPAA compliant, (ii) utilize the highest level of audit logging in connection with its use of all Customer Applications, and (iii) maintain the maximum retention of logs in connection with its use of all Services.</li> <li>HIPAA Account Appropriate Configurations: Customer is solely responsible for configuring, and will configure, all Customer Applications as follows:</li> <li>Encryption. Customer shall encrypt all PHI stored or transmitted outside the Services in accordance with the Secretary of HHS's Guidance to Render Unsecured Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals, available at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/guidance/index.html, as it may be updated from time to time, and as may be made available on any successor or related site designated by HHS.</li> <li>TLS Termination: All services must be served via TLS. Customer is responsible for providing, maintaining and updating a valid TLS certificate for use with the Service. TLS certificates must be a minimum of 4096 bit key size. Customer agrees to comply with Business Associate's requirements regarding TLS termination.</li> <li>Necessary Consents. Customer warrants that it has obtained any necessary authorizations, consents, and other permissions that may be required under applicable law prior to placing Customer Content, including without limitation PHI, on the Services.</li> <li>Restrictions on Disclosures. Customer shall not agree to any restriction requests or place any restrictions in any notice of privacy practices that would cause Business Associate to violate this BAA or any applicable law.</li> <li>Compliance with HIPAA. Customer shall not request or cause Business Associate to make a Use or Disclosure of PHI in a manner that does not comply with HIPAA or this BAA.</li> <li>Term and Termination</li> <li>Term. The term of this BAA will commence on the Smylen Agreement Effective Date and will remain in effect until the earlier of the termination of the Smylen Agreement or notification by Customer that an account is no longer subject to this BAA.</li> <li>Effect of Termination. At termination of this BAA, Business Associate, if feasible, will return or destroy all PHI that Business Associate still maintains, if any. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this Agreement to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make not further use or disclosure of PHI.</li> <li>If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer's account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer's servers has been compromised, or the Agreement was terminated by Customer's failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: (i) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer account or (ii) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer's account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Customer data on to media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer expense. Business Associate's efforts to copy Customer data onto Customer media shall be billable as an Additional Service at Business Associate's then current hourly rates.</li> <li>No Agency Relationship. As set forth in the Agreement, nothing in this BAA is intended to make either party an agent of the other. Nothing in this BAA is intended to confer upon Customer the right or authority to control Business Associate's conduct in the course of Business Associate complying with the Agreement and BAA.</li> <li>Nondisclosure. Customer agrees that the terms of this BAA are not publicly known and constitute Business Associate Confidential Information under the Agreement.</li> <li>Entire Agreement; Conflict. Except as amended by this BAA, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This BAA, together with the Agreement as amended by this BAA: (a) is intended by the parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of the terms of their agreement; and (b) supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether oral or written) between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. If there is a conflict between the Agreement, this BAA or any other amendment or BAA to the Agreement or this BAA, the document later in time will prevail.</li> <li>Miscellaneous.<ol> <li>Amendment. Customer and Business Associate agrees to take such action as is reasonably necessary to amend this HIPAA BAA from time to time as is necessary for either party to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and related laws and regulations.</li> <li>Survival. Customer and Business Associate's respective rights and obligations under this HIPAA BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</li> <li>Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Smylen Agreement shall be resolved to permit Customer to comply with HIPAA and the Privacy Rule.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>SIGNATURE FOLLOWS</p>"},{"location":"24-hipaa_mapping_to_smylen_controls/","title":"24.
